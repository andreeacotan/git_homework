In th Git+gGitHub training I have learned wht it is a VCS why it is useful.
Also I learned why Git it is a powerfull, who to work with it and how to set up it.
Why GitHub helps you with the whole process

I have learned how to set up a public key in GitHub, because one of the challenges I faced was tha I could not push changes into remote repository.
I think that this exercise was usefull since I've done a recap about git and github and learned new things.
